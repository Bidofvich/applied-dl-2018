### About
Tel-Aviv Deep Learning Bootcamp is an intensive (and free!) 5-day program intended to teach you all about deep learning. It is nonprofit focused on advancing data science education and fostering entrepreneurship. The Bootcamp is a prominent venue for graduate students, researchers, and data science professionals. It offers a chance to study the essential and innovative aspects of deep learning.	


#### Registration:
You can register, however we reserve no places, folowing a first come first serve policy. 

### Requirements

## Data Sets in PyTorch 
Keep in mind that this repository expects data to be in same format as Imagenet. I encourage you to use your own datasets. 
In that case you need to organize your data such that your dataset folder has EXACTLY two folders. Name these 'train' and 'val'

**The 'train' folder contains training set and 'val' fodler contains validation set on which accuracy / log loss is measured.**  

The structure within 'train' and 'val' folders will be the same. 
They both contain **one folder per class**. 
All the images of that class are inside the folder named by class name; this is crucial in PyTorch. 

If your dataset has 2 classes like in the Kaggle Statoil set, and you're trying to classify between pictures of 1) ships 2) Icebergs, 
say you name your dataset folder 'data_directory'. Then inside 'data_directory' will be 'train' and 'test'. 
Further, Inside 'train' will be 2 folders - 'ships', 'icebergs'. 

## So, the structure looks like this: 

![curve](assets/dataset.png)

```
|-  data_dir
       |- train 
             |- ships
                  |- ship_image_1
                  |- ship_image_2
                         .....

             |- ice
                  |- ice_image_1
                  |- ice_image_1
                         .....
       |- val
             |- ships
             |- ice
```
